# JAI Work Status Protocol

Project name must be the current VS Code project name (workspace folder name). Use that value for `<project>`.

If project context needs verification, use:

```bash
jai get -p "<project>"
```

At the beginning of agent work, set the project status to `RUNNING` with a short description of current work.

```bash
jai set -p "<project>" -s RUNNING -d "<what you are working on now>"
```

At the end of agent work, set the project status to `REVIEW_REQUIRED` with a concise done summary and what needs review.

```bash
jai set -p "<project>" -s REVIEW_REQUIRED -d "<done summary and what needs review>"
```

Use concrete descriptions, not generic text like "working" or "done".
