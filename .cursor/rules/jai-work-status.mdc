# JAI Work Status Protocol

Project name must be the current VS Code project name (workspace folder name). Use that value for `<project>`.

If project context needs verification, use:

```bash
jai get -p "<project>"
```

At the beginning of agent work, start a new task to claim a unique index:

```bash
INDEX=$(jai start -p "<project>" -d "<what you are working on now>")
```

The command prints the assigned numeric index. Use it for all subsequent updates.

At the end of agent work, update the status with the assigned index:

```bash
jai notify -p "<project>" -i "$INDEX" -d "<done summary and what needs review>"
```
When you follow up the task on the next prompt, use the same index.

When the user says `jai queue` or `jai queue <description>`, add the current remaining task to the queue:

```bash
jai queue -p "<project>" -d "<description of remaining work>"
```

If the user provided a description after `jai queue`, use it. Otherwise, infer a concrete description from the current context.

Use concrete descriptions, not generic text like "working" or "done".
